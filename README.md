## My First Website

Hmm,its actually a fork of The PixysOS Project website . The reason why I'm keeping this source in my github is because it has inspired me to learn responsive website designing .

I was impressed by the design of this website and I tried to make some modifications to this website but that actually didn't work out so I decided to learn HTML,CSS and JavaScript to know how these things work under the hood.

You can see the actual source of this website by visiting PixysOS github page.

I have worked as a maintainer in PixysOS Project and this website is made by YashGarg bro.He is a great Designer and if you want to get in touch with him then you can log on to https://yash-garg.github.io
